            <!-- <em><p class="copyHeader summaryHeader">SUMMARY</p></em> -->
            <em><p class="summaryCopy">SUMMARY: Who are America's Got Talent (AGT) winners? Transforming data on AGT
                winners into a functional concept allows NBC to take advantage of research
                and increase viewer interest at the same time. Potential contestants can check their chance ofwinning
                against AGTâ€™s history and viewers can see if their next vote will change the 
                trends.</p></em>
            <p class="copyHeader">PROJECT INSTRUCTIONS</p>
            <p class="copy">NBC has hired your team to help them understand what
                AGT fans like about the winners of their show. Are winners
                selected purely on talent, or are there other factors at play? Are contestants more
                likely to win if they have a particular talent? NBC wants to better understand what
                the makeup of an AGT champion is so that they can use that information to guide their
                2019 audition selection process.</p>
            <p class="copyHeader">METHOD</p>
            <p class="copy"> Figure 1 shows the steps my team completed to accomplish our objectives. Each chapter
                of the deliverable goes into detail regarding the different phases of the project. The final page
                details the steps required to complete the next phase of the project. </p>

            </figure>
            <p class="copy">Before creating the deliverable, I referred to Chapter 8: Deliverable Basics
                in Communicating Design by Dan Brown. I included the key elements he recommends as shown
                in Figure 2. Consistency, alignment, content hierarchy, and legibility are incorporated to
                create a usable document that conveys the overall purpose of the project, including the key questions
                and issues that need to be addressed for the project to move forward.

            <p class="copyHeader">THINGS I WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY</p>
            <p class="copy">Several of the pages featured a dark gray background
                with white text. While this design was included to visually break up the document, I received feedback
                that repeating this design gives the impression that the pages are related or indicate a new section of
                the document. Rather than repeating the same design, I would use multiple variations to keep the design of the
                document fresh.
